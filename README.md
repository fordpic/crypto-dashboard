## CryptoWatch

CryptoWatch is a site for quickly reviewing important metrics regarding cryptocurrencies. Powered by the CoinGecko API, CryptoWatch can pull up token-specific information for various assets of all market caps, complete with a dedicated chart and time-based statistics for each and every asset supported.

There are no user accounts and no paywalls - everything is completely free.

The deployed app can be found at this link: [CryptoWatch Deployment]()

### Technology Used

- NextJS + TypeScript as the framework
- TailwindCSS for styling
- SWR for quick & efficient data fetching
- Recharts for building intuitive price charts
- Dayjs for date parsing
- CoinGecko API for data

### Inspiration

When I was first starting to learn to program a few years ago, one of the very first applications I built was a similar one - a cryptocurrency app that used an API to pull and display data meaningfully. As my skills have naturally improved over time, I figured this was a great project to throw together to see how far I've come and how clean I can make the resulting codebase.

### Next Steps

This is the MVP implementation of CryptoWatch - things can always be improved upon! Looking forward, I will be working to implement the following features into CryptoWatch as well:

- Search functionality
- Additional time periods for charts with an option to toggle between them
- Additional API(s) for more asset coverage
